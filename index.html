    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I’m John Mbusyo, a passionate web designer and developer based in Kenya. With a keen eye for aesthetics and a strong foundation in coding, I specialize in creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites that not only meet the needs of my clients but also provide an engaging experience for their users.
        My journey into web design began with a fascination for technology and creativity. I believe that a well-designed website is a powerful tool for communication and can significantly impact a brand's success. Over the years, I have honed my skills in various technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and popular frameworks, allowing me to bring innovative ideas to life.
        I take pride in my ability to blend functionality with creativity, ensuring that every project I undertake is tailored to the unique goals of my clients. Whether it's a personal blog, a corporate website, or an e-commerce platform, I strive to deliver high-quality work that exceeds expectations.
        In addition to my technical skills, I am committed to staying updated with the latest industry trends and best practices. I believe in continuous learning and often engage in online courses and workshops to enhance my knowledge and skills.
        When I’m not designing or coding, you can find me exploring the beautiful landscapes of Kenya, enjoying local cuisine, or connecting with fellow creatives in the tech community.
        Let’s connect and bring your vision to life!</p>
